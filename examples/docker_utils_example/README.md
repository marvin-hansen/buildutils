This example demonstrates how to use the `docker_utils` crate to manage Docker containers in your Rust integration tests.

## Features

- Postgres container configuration and setup
- Error handling and status verification
- Container port mapping

Run the example with Cargo:
```bash
cargo test -p docker_utils_example
```
