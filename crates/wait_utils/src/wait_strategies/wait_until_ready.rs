/// Retry `probe` until it reports ready, it reports fatal, or `timeout` elapses.
///
/// Every [`WaitStrategy`](crate::WaitStrategy) variant is a fixed predicate this crate
/// implements. None of them can express "the operation I am about to perform succeeds", which
/// is the only predicate that is never wrong. That probe is caller code, so this is a
/// function taking a closure rather than another variant of the enum.
///
/// Bounded by a deadline rather than an attempt count: attempts multiplied by delay silently
/// shrinks the real wait whenever an attempt is itself slow, which is exactly what happens on
/// the loaded machine the budget exists for.
///
/// The probe always runs at least once, even when the timeout is zero.
///
/// Consecutive identical retry messages are collapsed in the debug log. A starting service
/// repeats the same refusal for as long as it takes, and printing it a hundred times buries
/// the one line that differs, which is always the interesting one.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `dbg` - Whether to print the progress of the wait.
/// * `timeout` - How long to keep retrying before giving up.
/// * `retry_delay` - How long to wait between attempts.
/// * `probe` - The readiness check to run.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns whatever the probe built, or a `WaitStrategyError` if the probe reported a fatal
/// failure or the timeout elapsed.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use wait_utils::{Probe, wait_until_ready};
///
/// let mut attempts = 0;
/// let ready = wait_until_ready(false, Duration::from_secs(60), Duration::from_millis(1), || {
///     attempts += 1;
///     if attempts < 3 {
///         Probe::Retry("not yet".to_string())
///     } else {
///         Probe::Ready(attempts)
///     }
/// });
